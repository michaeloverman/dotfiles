# My dotfiles

Just beginning to organize and backup my config and customization files. Hoping this will simplify things, and when it comes to using or migrating to a new machine, it should TOTALLY smooth that out...
Currently just tracking a few config files, but will slowly expand to including some tools installation and the like, as I learn more, remember to add things here, and generally get my mind around making these things simpler for myself.

## Installation
Open terminal, clone this repository, run `./bootstrap.exclude.sh`
That should be it.

## Credit
Basic starter code and approach to this effort found here:
